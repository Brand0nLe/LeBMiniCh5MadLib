# Mini Challenge 5 - Mad Lib
# Project will save 10 user inputs as strings and print them out into a mad lib story. The user has the option to play again or end. Also has data validation for both words and numbers in the user inputs and play again.

# Peer Review: Mark Ramirez
ok works great the validation for entry's works the story is nice however the restart function need to be fixed it says try again if i put in a WORD other than yes or no however if i put a number it starts again
